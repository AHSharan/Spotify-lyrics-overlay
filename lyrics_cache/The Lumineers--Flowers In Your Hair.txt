When we were younger we thought
everyone was on our side
& then we grew a little, and romanticized
the time I saw, flowers in your hair
See it takes a boy to live

takes a man to pretend he was there



So then we grew a little

& knew a lot

& now we demonstrated it to the cops

& all the things we said, we were self assured



Cause it's a long road to wisdom

But it's a short one to being ignored



Me & my eyes

Me & my heart

Me & my eyes, ay ay ay

Me & my heart



So now I think that I could, love you back

& I hope it's not too late

cause you're so attractive

& the way you move

I won't close my eyes



Cause it takes a man to live

But it takes a woman to make him compromise



So me & my eyes

Me & my heart

Me & my eyes, ay ay ay

Me & my heart
