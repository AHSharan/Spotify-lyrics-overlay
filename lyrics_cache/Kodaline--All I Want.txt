All I want is nothing more
to hear you knocking at my door
'cause if i could see your face once more
I could die a happy man I'm sure
when you said your last goodbye

I died a little bit inside

I lay in tears in bed all night

alone without you by my side



but If you loved me

why did you leave me



take my body

take my body

all I want is

all I need is

to find somebody

I'll find somebody

like you



oooohhhh ohhh



'cause you brought out the best of me

a part of me I'd never seen

you took my soul wiped it clean

our love was made for movie screens



but If you loved me

why did you leave me

take my body

take my body

all I want is

all I need is

to find somebody

I'll find somebody

like you



ooooohhhhhh

if you loved me

why did you leave me

take my body

take my body

all I want is

all I need is

to find somebody

I'll find somebody



like you

oooohhh
