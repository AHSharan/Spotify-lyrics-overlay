(Yeah)How can you look at me and pretendI'm someone you've never met?[Bridge]The devil in your eyesWon't deny the lies you've soldI'm holding on too tightWhile you let goThis is casual

[Chorus]How can we go back to being friendsWhen we just shared a bed? (Yeah)How can you look at me and pretendI'm someone you've never met?How can we go back to being friendsWhen we just shared a bed? (Yeah)How can you look at me and pretendI'm someone you've never met?[Outro]I'm someone you've never met (Yeah)
